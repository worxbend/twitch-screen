## K-011: Non-atomic compound read of TwitchAuth state (current, accessToken, scopes)

- Severity: Medium-bug. Area: relay-twitch.
- **Disposition: fixed.** It closes the `[partial]` gap: the two compound reads that were left.

### Change

- `twitch-screen-relay/src/twitchscreen/relay/twitch/TwitchAuth.scala`
  - Deleted the `handle` OAuth2Credential. Its getters each called `view` or `current` on their own, so `getAccessToken` and `getUserId`/`getScopes` could come from different grants.
  - Deleted the public `credential`, `current`, `accessToken` and no-arg `missingScopes`. Only tests used them.
  - Removed the imports that became unused: `OAuth2Credential`, `TwitchIdentityProvider` and `scala.jdk.CollectionConverters.*`.
  - Added the pure `missingScopesOf(granted: UserToken)`. `view` uses the same method to build its `missingScopes`, so the two cannot drift apart.
  - The warning in `completeAuthorization` now computes its missing scopes from `issued` instead of re-reading state.
  - Rewrote the class doc. Every read now goes through `view`, which builds one `AuthorizationView` from a single `state.get()`. Twitch4J gets an immutable `TwitchOAuthClient.credentialOf(plan.grant)` snapshot for each subscription plan. A refresh or rejection triggers a resubscribe and does not mutate a credential Twitch4J already holds.
- `twitch-screen-relay/src/twitchscreen/relay/twitch/TwitchAuthApi.scala`: `callback` now uses `auth.missingScopesOf(granted)`, so the caveat on the success page and the login it shows come from the same grant. `status()` already read a single `view` and is unchanged.
- `twitch-screen-relay/test/src/twitchscreen/relay/twitch/TwitchAuthSuite.scala`
  - `ScriptedTwitch.exchange("partial")` now issues a grant that lacks `moderator:read:followers`.
  - New tests:
    - "the callback page reports the scopes missing from the grant it just installed"
    - "missing scopes are computed from the issued grant, not re-read from state"
    - "Twitch4J receives an immutable credential snapshot"
  - Migrated calls: `auth.current` became `auth.view.held`. `auth.accessToken` became the suite helper `usableAccess(auth)`, which is `view.usable.map(_.accessToken.value)`. `auth.missingScopes` became `auth.view.missingScopes`. `auth.credential` became `auth.view.usable`. The `handle` assertions now assert on the usable grant. Every race and persistence assertion is kept.
  - Renamed tests:
    - "...and the handle twitch4j holds follows it" became "...and the usable grant follows it".
    - "sign-out racing a refresh cannot restore the credential handle or persisted grant" became "...cannot restore the usable grant or persisted grant".
    - "new consent racing refresh retains the new grant in memory handle and file" became "...retains the new grant as the usable grant and in the file".

### Red, then green

- Red: before the production change, `./mill --no-daemon test.testOnly 'twitchscreen.relay.twitch.TwitchAuthSuite'` failed to compile with `value missingScopesOf is not a member of twitchscreen.relay.twitch.TwitchAuth`.
- The callback-page test pins the behaviour the fix needs. It cannot reproduce the race deterministically through the stub interpreter. The race is proven by the "not re-read from state" test: after `signOut()`, `missingScopesOf(granted)` still reports `moderator:read:followers`, while `view.missingScopes` reports every configured scope.

### Validation (run from `twitch-screen-relay/`)

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `./mill --no-daemon test.testOnly 'twitchscreen.relay.twitch.*'` | SUCCESS. 10 suites, 105 tests, 0 failed. `TwitchAuthSuite` has 18 tests, up from 15. |
| `grep -rnE '\.(credential\|current\|accessToken)\b' src` | No call on a `TwitchAuth`. The remaining hits are `UserToken.accessToken` (TwitchOAuthClient:79, SubscriptionPlan:14, TokenFile:93, TwitchAuth:54 inside `rejectAccessToken`, AuthorizationView:7), `ThreadLocalRandom.current` (TwitchRetry:13, DeviceHub:132), `Span.current` (SetTraceIdInMDCInterceptor:19) and `RelayVersion.current` (RelayMetrics:16, StatusApi:63, HttpApi:33). |
| `grep -rn 'auth\.missingScopes\b' src` | no matches (exit 1) |
| `./mill --no-daemon compile` | SUCCESS, with `-Werror` |
| `./mill --no-daemon test` | SUCCESS. 37 suites, 421 tests, 0 failed, 0 ignored. |
| `./mill --no-daemon mill.scalalib.scalafmt/checkFormatAll` | SUCCESS |
